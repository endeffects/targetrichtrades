Dev plan:
1) Add spv for trade entry(done), todo: hooo up with entry signal; 
	1-2)hook up trade management(done);
2) Multiple markets testing;
3-1) Breakout Pattern-1: open/morning breakout the overnight range(first hour, first 30 minutes range),
 target vs range as the risk; (3-4 bars breakout setup on the SnR line)
3-2) Breakout Pattern-2: open/morning breakout, the first pullback evaluation: 38.2/50/61.8
3-3) Breakout Pattern-3: breakout the narrow range: three types of range a) flat range, b) expanding wedge, c) shrinking wedge;
 to find the trade, count the legs in the range, for a) three legs formed before breakout;
 for b) at least two points expanding; the first big leg breakout attempt could be false breakout, it happened to morning open breakout; 
 for c) at least shrink to half of the initial range, with two or three points shrinking;
 combined with volatility measurement to define stop loss and target;
3-4) Breakout Pattern-: beat the strongest head(false breakout): the breakout from a narrow range got reversed; at the end of the trend, the last breakout got reversed;
5) Trending/pullback Pattern-1: early-trend pullback, mid-trend pullback, late-trend pullback;
5-1) Pullback Pivot: left 20+, right 5+, i.e. (20+, 5+)
5-2) Trending pivot: breakout the pullback pivot, create a new (5+, 5+) pivot
6) ES noon time range Pattern-1: resume or reversal?
7) ZiZag: add percentage of the underling ZZ size as the threshold to generate new ZZ/pivot point;
8) Volatility measurement: ZZ by 25% retracement;
9) Volume: check the first volume burst in the morning as the session start, 8:35 - 9:00;

Meeting minutes 03/01/2019
Gann: 50%, 75%, 25% instead of Fib ratios;

Find trades with SnR and SMI:
trending market: the red inflection keep trending up, the SMI keep up, buy at the previous green inflection, until get the divergence action: SMI moving down, get out the trade;
The measurement of the 50% of the SnR of the morning opening;
negative inflection: red, or resistance;

Test inflections against SMI readings to determine trend -matching inflections against SMI readings to determine if still holding momentum
Look for divergence,
 if not, we can set up a trade in the direction of trend with risk at parameters of prior inflections;
If divergent, meaning smi not following direction of price, we are looking for a trade of reversal;
FOr a short, we locate the last high of the red diamond, and the last high of the cyan diamond and when we lose that level, we go short
(*Maybe too late to entry until lose that spt level;
*how long to hold the entry order, and how to deal with next signal? );
Testing for divergence
At inflection, measure the SMI reading
For negative inflection
When next negative inflection shows, measure SMI reading
If negative inflection of n-1 has a lower high price than the negative inflection of candle n, 
AND SMI of n-1 candle is HIGHER than SMI of n candle, then we have divergence

Order: entry order cancellation-look back to decide if the market condition  has been changed or not; 

Issues:
1) Exception handling: the expected condition does not exist;
2) Risk parameters: if it's too large, take the trade or not?
