* Breakeven; - done;

* Trailinig entry;

* Trailing stop loss after a target is reached;

* OnBarUpdate: check position, exit trade or entry trade? curStg: check signal;
baseStg: check performance, check newOrderAllowed? check Exit, check Entry, putTrade;
How to use signal: entry always needs signal; exit: check signal first or check the performance first(performance first)?

* ChangeSLPT:
		/// For position exit OCO order adjustment
		/// breakEvenAmt<MinLock<ProfitTargetAmt<MaxLock
		/// ** Check trailing stop loss if PnL>MaxLock
		/// ** Check trailing profit target if ProfitTargetAmt<PnL<MaxLock
		///   * Keep moving target away;
		///   * Keep stop loss at MinLock no change;
		/// ** Check stop loss:
		///   * Check if MinLock<PnL, lock stop loss to MinLock
		///   * Keep target no change;
		/// ** Check BreakEven:
		///   * If PnL>breakEvenAmt, set SL to breakeven;
		///   * Keep target no change;

* Gambling theory: 
	** 1-2-3-4 attempts; track win/lose trades;
	** 50% WR;
	** Scale in for losing trades: 2x, 3x, 4x or more...., 
	or start to scale in after a series of losing trades such as 3 times losing trade in a row, start to scale in;
	** Preset W/L ratio 1.0~2.0; expected to work for breakout with better W/L ratio;
	** Develop a simulator to calculate for different parameters combination;
