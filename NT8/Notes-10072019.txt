Dev plan:
1) Add spv for trade entry(done), todo: hooo up with entry signal; 
	1-2)hook up trade management(done);
2) Multiple markets testing;
3-1) Breakout Pattern-1: open/morning breakout the overnight range(first hour, first 30 minutes range),
 target vs range as the risk; (3-4 bars breakout setup on the SnR line)
3-2) Breakout Pattern-2: open/morning breakout, the first pullback evaluation: 38.2/50/61.8
3-3) Breakout Pattern-3: breakout the narrow range: three types of range a) flat range, b) expanding wedge, c) shrinking wedge;
 to find the trade, count the legs in the range, for a) three legs formed before breakout;
 for b) at least two points expanding; the first big leg breakout attempt could be false breakout, it happened to morning open breakout; 
 for c) at least shrink to half of the initial range, with two or three points shrinking;
 combined with volatility measurement to define stop loss and target;
3-4) Breakout Pattern-4: beat the strongest head(false breakout): the breakout from a narrow range got reversed; at the end of the trend, the last breakout got reversed;
5) Trending/pullback Pattern-1: early-trend pullback, mid-trend pullback, late-trend pullback;
5-1) Pullback Pivot: left 20+, right 5+, i.e. (20+, 5+)
5-2) Trending pivot: breakout the pullback pivot, create a new (5+, 5+) pivot
6) ES noon time range Pattern-1: resume or reversal?
7) ZiZag: add percentage of the underling ZZ size as the threshold to generate new ZZ/pivot point;
8) Volatility measurement: ZZ by 25% retracement;
9) Volume: check the first volume burst in the morning as the session start, 8:35 - 9:00;
10) Signal combination: volatility+direction+momentum;
10-1) Define a list of signals for each bar to look back previous signals;(done)
11) Market Context definition for spvPR: 
12) Reversal pattern:
12-1) 1-2-3-4 reversal: after the trend lasts at least 30 mins; 1-the first reversal attempt failed; 2-the last trend resumption creat new high/low; 3-two bar reversal or hammer/wick appears; 4-the first pull-back of the reversal swing is the entry point;
 


Meeting minutes 03/01/2019
Gann: 50%, 75%, 25% instead of Fib ratios;

Find trades with SnR and SMI:
trending market: the red inflection keep trending up, the SMI keep up, buy at the previous green inflection, until get the divergence action: SMI moving down, get out the trade;
The measurement of the 50% of the SnR of the morning opening;
negative inflection: red, or resistance;

Test inflections against SMI readings to determine trend -matching inflections against SMI readings to determine if still holding momentum
Look for divergence,
 if not, we can set up a trade in the direction of trend with risk at parameters of prior inflections;
If divergent, meaning smi not following direction of price, we are looking for a trade of reversal;
FOr a short, we locate the last high of the red diamond, and the last high of the cyan diamond and when we lose that level, we go short
(*Maybe too late to entry until lose that spt level;
*how long to hold the entry order, and how to deal with next signal? );
Testing for divergence
At inflection, measure the SMI reading
For negative inflection
When next negative inflection shows, measure SMI reading
If negative inflection of n-1 has a lower high price than the negative inflection of candle n, 
AND SMI of n-1 candle is HIGHER than SMI of n candle, then we have divergence

Order: entry order cancellation-look back to decide if the market condition has been changed or not; 

Issues:
1) Exception handling: the expected condition does not exist;
2) Risk parameters: if it's too large, take the trade or not?

circle for smi (-50, 50), diamond for >50 or <-50

record the cross and level of the cross for SMI;
the current price - KAMA, if the number is >= 0, we know the price is above KAMA,
if the corss is <-40, then support defined as 5 candles low (stop level);
resistance will be the  prior cross and it's the first target;
** the peaks between (-40, 40) will be circles instead of diamond;
the target will be high/low of the diamond;
Only cross over from -40, 40 up/down to 40,-40 will be trigger;

**Perhaps cirles to identify crossovers in SMI between -50 and 50 and use diamonds for crossovers above 50 and below -50
** Goal to make the SMI less sensiteve for th 1 min chart for scalping
** Measurement of interest - distance in ticks from the price to the KAMA
** Record the cross and the level at the cross of the SMI that is (Current price)
current price - KAMA >=0 then we know the price is above the KAMA and the KAMA gives us relative support
** If level cross in SMI is <=40 (let's play with that #), we it's an extreme level so it sends us to the second shell
support then defined as 5 candle low, Ultimate risk threshold there
Resistance will be the prior cross and the first target
(let's assume we always move with number of contract 2 or more
Peaks and valleys give us support and resistance
Peaks and valleys between -40 and 40 give us new regions of support and resistance
Candle that holds inflection diamond will give us the target - use the high for long target and the low for short target
Only positive crossovers in deep oversold territory
Only negative crossovers in high overbought territory
We need to work on the SMI some more - change levels...

Hook up signal with trading:
** 8,8,8,8,12, TMA_Period for cyan/red 6?
** Red diamond sell, cyan diamond buy;
** KAMA as trending indicator; 2,10,30?
