AWO: sma - > EMA, or sma -> 20, 5,(34, 5), TMA, Triangular MA;
Done;

Target: cross over 0 of AWO, high/low of the bar as TG; inflection sign need to exit;

entry: TMA 3, 15, inflection and over or below the TMA then entry, 
the last inflection is the first target, the next inflection is next target;
or the 0 cross before of AWO could be the target;

looking for short: inflection zone neg, look back to the cross over if the bar is bearish, 
the open set as resistance, if the bar is bullish, the close set as resistance; if we below 
MA, AW is <0, then entry: the bar after inflection bar;
From Anne-Marie:
Mechanics for negative cross -so far looks like this - isolate the last inflection - 
if that last inflection is negative, we do a lookback to the crossover 
and if that candle is bearish we isolate the open as resistance; 
if that candlestick is bullish we isolate the close as resistance
Then we identify yes/no for 1) are we below the moving average and 
2) is the awesome oscillator below zero/
If both gates are yes, we now can stage the entry
We take the trade at the open of the next candlestick after the inflection zone
