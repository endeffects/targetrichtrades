Dev plan:
1) Add spv for trade entry; hook up trade management;
2) Multiple markets testing;
3) Breakout Pattern-1: open/morning breakout the overnight range, target vs range as the risk;
4) Breakout Pattern-2: open/mourning breakout, the first pullback evaluation: 38.2/50/61.8
5) Trending/pullback Pattern-1: early-trend pullback, mid-trend pullback, late-trend pullback;
6) ES noon time range Pattern-1: resume or reversal?
7) ZiZag: add percentage of the underling ZZ size as the threshold to generate new ZZ/pivot point;
8) Volatility measurement:

Meeting minutes 03/01/2019
Gann: 50%, 75%, 25% instead of Fib ratios;

Find trades with SnR and SMI:
trending market: the red inflection keep trending up, the SMI keep up, buy at the previous green inflection, until get the divergence action: SMI moving down, get out the trade;
The measurement of the 50% of the SnR of the morning opening;
negative inflection: red, or resistance;

Test inflections against SMI readings to determine trend -matching inflections against SMI readings to determine if still holding momentumLook for divergence,
 if not, we can set up a trade in the direction of trend with risk at parameters of prior inflections;
If divergent, meaning smi not following direction of price, we are looking for a trade of reversal;
FOr a short, we locate the last high of the red diamond, and the last high of the cyan diamond and when we lose that level, we go short;
Testing for divergence
At inflection, measure the SMI reading
For negative inflection
When next negative inflection shows, measure SMI reading
If negative inflection of n-1 has a lower high price than the negative inflection of candle n, 
AND SMI of n-1 candle is HIGHER than SMI of n candle, then we have divergence
