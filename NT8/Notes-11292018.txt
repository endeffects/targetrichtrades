AWO: sma - > EMA, or sma -> 20, 5,(34, 5), TMA, Triangular MA;

Target: cross over 0 of AWO, high/low of the bar as TG; inflection sign need to exit;

entry: TMA 3, 15, inflection and over or below the TMA then entry, 
the last inflection is the first target, the next inflection is next target;
or the 0 cross before of AWO could be the target;

AWO: (34,5), plot on the chart when the color changed, 

Mechanics for negative cross -so far looks like this -
 isolate the last inflection - if that last inflection is negative, we do a lookback to the crossover ad if that candle is bearish we isolate the open as resistance; 
 if that candlestick is bullish we isolate the close as resistance. 
 Then we identify yes/no for 1) are we below the moving average 
 and 2) is the awesome oscillator below zero/
 If both gates are yes, we now can stage the entry
 We take the trade at the open of the next candlestick (after the inflection zone???)
